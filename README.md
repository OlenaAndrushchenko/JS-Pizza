# JS-Pizza

## Level 1:

- Elaboration of a pizza with JavaScript using variables, functions, and console.log() from a single file (app.js) without modularization.
- Expected terminal output: steps followed for the elaboration until delivery to the customer.
- Example of terminal output (you don't have to follow the exact steps):

### Output:
mix 30 grams of fresh yeast with 2Â½ cups of warm water
add 2 tablespoons of olive oil
add bread flour
add 1 teaspoon of fine salt
knead well until no longer sticky
shape the dough into 4 pizzas
4 portions obtained
base for 1 pizza
Let the base for 1 pizza rest for 45 min
Circular shaped base obtained
added Tomato sauce
added Mozzarella
added Pepperoni
added 4 Black Olives
Baking the pizza for 10 min
Pizza ready
Pizza Delivered

## Level 2:

- The software will now allow interaction with the customer through the terminal (using the Node package prompt-sync).
- The customer will order the pizza by typing the name of the pizza in the terminal.
- The code should be modular.

### Example of terminal output:

Input: And your pizza is ... (pepperoni): pepperoni

Output:
Pizza pepperoni in preparation
Taking the dough
Stretching the dough
Adding tomato
Adding mozzarella
Adding pepperoni
Baking the pizza
Pizza ready
Pizza delivered


## Extra Challenge:

- The software should allow the preparation of any pizza added to the list of available pizzas, and if the pizza does not exist, then a message should be returned to the customer.
